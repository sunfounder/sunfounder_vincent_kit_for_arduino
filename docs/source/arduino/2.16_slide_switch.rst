2.16 Slide Switch
==================

Overview
------------

In this lesson, you will get to know something about Switch. A slide
switch, just as its name implies, is to slide the switch bar to connect
or break the circuit, and further switch circuits. The slide switch is
commonly used in low-voltage circuit. It has the features of flexibility
and stability, and applies in electric instruments and electric toys
widely.

Components Required

* :ref:`cpn_mega2560`
* :ref:`cpn_breadboard`
* :ref:`cpn_wires`
* :ref:`cpn_resistor`
* :ref:`cpn_slide`
* :ref:`cpn_capacitor`

Fritzing Circuit
---------------------

In this example, digital pin 2 is used to read the signal of Switch. In
addition, you need to connect a 10 kΩ resistor and a 104 capacitor in
parallel to form a RC circuit (Resistor - Capacitance circuit) which is
set between pin 2 and GND to realize debounce that may arise from your 
toggle of switch.

Code

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.16_switch.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\2.16_switch`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE 1/2.
    * Or click **Open Code** to open it in `Web Editor <https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor>`_.
    * Then :ref:`ar_upload_code` to the board.

After the codes are uploaded to the Mega2560 board, you can open the
serial monitor to check the readings of the pin. When the Switch toggles
to the left, the serial monitor displays 「1」; when toggles to the
right, the serial monitor displays「0」. Refer to :ref:`digital_read` to check the code explanation.
