2.11 Passive Buzzer
===================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will get to know about passive buzzer. As a type of
electronic buzzer with an integrated structure, passive buzzer is
supplied by DC power, widely used in computer, alarm, electronic toy,
telephone, timer and other electronic products or voice devices.

Components Required

* :ref:`cpn_breadboard`
* :ref:`cpn_wires`
* :ref:`cpn_buzzer`


Fritzing Circuit

In this example, what we use to drive the buzzer is the pin 9. We get the cathode of the Buzzer to GND, and the anode to the digital pin 9.

Code

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.11_passiveBuzzer.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\2.11_passiveBuzzer`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

At the time when you finish uploading the codes to the Mega2560 board, you can hear a melody containing seven notes. 

Code Analysis
-------------

There are two points needing your attention:

1. ``tone()`` & ``noTone()``: This function is used to control the sound of the passive buzzer directly and its prototype is as follows: 

.. code-block:: arduino

    void tone(int pin, unsigned int frequency)
    void tone(int pin, unsigned int frequency, unsigned long duration)

Generates a square wave of the specified frequency (and 50% duty cycle) on a pin (so as to make the passive buzzer vibrate to make sound). A duration can be specified, otherwise the wave continues until a call to noTone(). The pin can be connected to a piezo buzzer or other speaker to play tones.

Only one tone can be generated at a time. If a tone is already playing on a different pin, the call to tone() will have no effect. If the tone is playing on the same pin, the call will set its frequency.

Use of the ``tone()`` function will interfere with PWM output on pins 3 and 11 (on boards other than the Mega).

It is not possible to generate tones lower than 31Hz.

**pin**: The Arduino pin on which to generate the tone.

**frequency**: The frequency of the tone in hertz.

**duration**: The duration of the tone in milliseconds (optional)

.. code-block:: arduino

    void noTone(int pin)

Stops the generation of a square wave triggered by ``tone()``. Has no effect if no tone is being generated.

**pin**: The Arduino pin on which to generate the tone.

Having known the two functions, you may grasp the codesâ€”the installation of the array melody[] and the array noteDurations[] is the preparation of the subsequently several times of calling of the function ``tone()`` and the changing of tone and duration in the loop for better effect of music play.

2. ``pitches.h``: The code uses an extra file, ``pitches.h``. This file contains all the pitch values for typical notes. For example, NOTE_C4 is middle C. NOTE_FS4 is F sharp, and so forth. This note table was originally written by Brett Hagman, on whose work the ``tone()`` command was based. You may find it useful whenever you want to make musical notes.

.. code-block:: arduino

    #include "pitches.h"

.. note::
    There is already a ``pitches.h`` file in this sample program. If we put it together with the main code in one folder, the successive steps of installing ``pitches.h`` can be omitted.

After you open the code 2.11passiveBuzzer, if you cannot open the
``pitches.h`` code, you can just install one manually. The steps are as
follows:

To make the ``pitches.h`` file, either click on the button just below the
serial monitor icon and choose "New Tab", or use Ctrl+Shift+N.

Then paste in the following code and save it as ``pitches.h``:
