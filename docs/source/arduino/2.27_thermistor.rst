2.27 Thermistor
===============

Overview
-------------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use thermistor. Thermistor can be
used as electronic circuit components for temperature compensation of
instrument circuits. In the current meter, flowmeter, gas analyzer, and
other devices. It can also be used for overheating protection,
contactless relay, constant temperature, automatic gain control, motor
start, time delay, color TV automatic degaussing, fire alarm and
temperature compensation.

Components Required

* :ref:`cpn_thermistor`

Fritzing Circuit
----------------------

In this example, we use the analog pin A0 to get the value of
Thermistor. One pin of thermistor is connected to 5V, and the other is
wired up to A0. At the same time, a 10kÎ© resistor is connected with the
other pin before connecting to GND.

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.27_thermistor.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\2.27_thermistor`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

After uploading the code to the Mega2560 board, you can open the serial
monitor to check the current temperature. The Kelvin temperature is
calculated according to the formula
**T\ K\ =1/(ln(R\ T/R\ N)/B+1/T\ N).**
