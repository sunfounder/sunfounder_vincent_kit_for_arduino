.. note::

    * You can open the file ``2.10_activeBuzzer.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\2.10_activeBuzzer`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE 1/2.
    * Or click **Open Code** to open it in `Web Editor <https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor>`_.
