1.1 Get Started with Arduino IDE
=======================================

Arduino is an open source platform with simple software and hardware.
You can pick it up in short time even if you are a beginner. It provides
an integrated development environment (IDE) for code compiling,
compatible with multiple control boards. So you can just download the
Arduino IDE, upload the sketches (i.e. the code files) to the board, and
then you can see relative experimental phenomena. For more information,
refer to http://www.arduino.cc.

Please follow the tutorial below to learn how to install the Arduino IDE, add libraries and upload code.
