1.10 State Change Detection
===========================

Overview
--------

When you use button, you can not only press down the button, light on
the LED, release the button, turn off the LED, but also can switch the
working state of the LED every time the button is pressed. In order to
achieve this effect, you need to know when the state of the button
changes from **off** to **on**, that is, "state change detection". In
this lesson, we will print the results of state change detection of the
button in the serial monitor.

Components Required

* :ref:`cpn_breadboard`
* :ref:`cpn_wires`
* :ref:`cpn_button`
* :ref:`cpn_resistor`


Fritzing Circuit
----------------

In this example, we use pin 2 to read the signal of the button.

.. note::

    * You can open the file ``1.10_stateChangeDetection.ino`` under the path of ``sunfounder_vincent_kit_for_arduino\code\1.10_stateChangeDetection`` directly.
    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

After the codes are uploaded into the Mega2560 board, the output number will switch between 0 and 1 every time you press the button.

Code Analysis
--------------

Declare a pin connected to Button.

.. code-block:: arduino

    const int  buttonPin = 2;  

Declare a variable called 「detectionState」to record every state of state change detection.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int detectionState = 0;   

Declare two variables to read the state of the button for state change detection.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int buttonState = 0;         
    int lastButtonState = 0;   

In setup(), initialize the pins and then start up the serial monitor.

.. code-block:: arduino

    pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);

In loop(), read the value of buttonPin and then assign to the variable buttonState. 

.. code-block:: arduino

    buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

Compare buttonState with lastButtonState, if they are not equal, it indicates that the state is changed. A delay(50) is needed to realize debouncing during the changing detection. After comparison, assign the buttonState to lastButtonState to make the next round of judgment.

.. code-block:: arduino

    if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    ...
        delay(50);
    }
    lastButtonState = buttonState;

The state change judgment installed (buttonState != lastButtonState), the further judgment is made to get the 
condition「Press the button」.

.. code-block:: arduino

    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    ...
        } 

Under the state「Press the button」, detectionState is being operated and it switches between 1 and 0. 
Meanwhile, the value of detectionState is printed.

.. code-block:: arduino

        detectionState=(detectionState+1)%2;
        Serial.print("The detection state is:");
        Serial.println(detectionState);
