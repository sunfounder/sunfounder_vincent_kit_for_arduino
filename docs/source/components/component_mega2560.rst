.. note::

    The SunFounder Mega board is a mainboard with almost the same functions as the `Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 <https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3?selectedStore=us>`_, and the two boards can be used interchangeably.

The SunFounder Mega Board is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560 (`datasheet <http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561-Datasheet-DS40002211A.pdf>`_). It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The SunFounder Mega Board board is compatible with most shields designed for the Uno and the former boards Duemilanove or Diecimila.
